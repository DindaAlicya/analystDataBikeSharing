# Analyst Data Bike Sharing Dataset

Hai! I just learned to do data analysis using python and this is the result of the data analysis that I did with the bike-sharing dataset source. This project is my first assignment in the "Belajar Data Analysis dengan Python" program from Dicoding, which I took through the DBS Foundation coding camp program. As my first experience in working on a Python-based project, I am very enthusiastic in exploring the data and creating interesting visualizations to present insights that can be taken from this dataset.

To see the final result of this project in the form of an interactive dashboard, i would like to you guys visit [my dashboard](https://analystdatabikesharing-qkgga4glscwzxyle4qxm4p.streamlit.app/).
